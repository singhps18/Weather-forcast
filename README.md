🌦️ Weather Forecast App

I created a simple weather forecast app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project is split into three files:

weather.html – the structure of the app

weather.css – the design and styling

weather.js – the logic that fetches and displays weather data

For real-time weather updates, I integrated the OpenWeather API using my own API key. When a user enters the name of a city, the app fetches live weather information like temperature, condition, and more.

This project was a great way to practice API integration, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and styling with CSS. It also gave me hands-on experience in handling user input and working with external data sources.
